## 🔍 Data Pipeline Stages

### 📥 1. Sentiment & Price Simulation
We generated 90 days of synthetic social media sentiment scores (ranging from -1 to +1) using a noisy sine function. Stock prices were then derived using these sentiment scores with additional randomness.

### 🔄 2. Data Processing
Data was structured into a daily time-series format. We computed correlation between sentiment and stock prices and prepared trendlines for visualization.

### 📊 3. Interactive Visualizations
The project includes three fully interactive Plotly graphs that show:
- Time-based sentiment trends
- Simulated stock price changes
- Correlation and regression line between sentiment and price
